abstract = {Individual neurons often produce highly variable responses over nominally identical trials, reflecting a mixture of intrinsic ‘noise’ and systematic changes in the animal’s cognitive and behavioral state. Disentangling these sources of variability is of great scientific interest in its own right, but it is also increasingly inescapable as neuroscientists aspire to study more complex and naturalistic animal behaviors. In these settings, behavioral actions never repeat themselves exactly and may rarely do so even approximately. Thus, new statistical methods that extract reliable features of neural activity using few, if any, repeated trials are needed. Accurate statistical modeling in this severely trial-limited regime is challenging, but still possible if simplifying structure in neural data can be exploited. We review recent works that have identified different forms of simplifying structure — including shared gain modulations across neural subpopulations, temporal smoothness in neural firing rates, and correlations in responses across behavioral conditions — and exploited them to reveal novel insights into the trial-by-trial operation of neural circuits.},

  abstract = "Summary Neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex alter their
              firing properties in response to environmental changes. This
              flexibility in neural coding is hypothesized to support
              navigation and memory by dividing sensory experience into unique
              episodes. However, it is unknown how the entorhinal circuit as a
              whole transitions between different representations when sensory
              information is not delineated into discrete contexts. Here we
              describe rapid and reversible transitions between multiple
              spatial maps of an unchanging task and environment. These
              remapping events were synchronized across hundreds of neurons,
              differentially affected navigational cell types, and correlated
              with changes in running speed. Despite widespread changes in
              spatial coding, remapping comprised a translation along a single
              dimension in population-level activity space, enabling simple
              decoding strategies. These findings provoke reconsideration of
              how the medial entorhinal cortex dynamically represents space and
              suggest a remarkable capacity of cortical circuits to rapidly and
              substantially reorganize their neural representations.",
